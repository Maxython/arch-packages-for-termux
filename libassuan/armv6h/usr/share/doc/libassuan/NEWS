------------------------------------------------

 * Now using libtool and builds a DSO.

 * Lots of interface cleanups.  See below for details of the most
   important changes.  Here is a quick note on how to upgrade:

   For each invocation of the connect or server functions, allocate a
   context with assuan_new and use that.  Instead of assuan_disconnect
   or assuan_deinit_server, call assuan_release.  Use
   assuan_set_gpg_err_source instead of assuan_set_assuan_err_source.
   If you use assuan_pipe_connect with NAME of NULL, you have to
   provide a non-NULL ARGV argument and check that against "server" or
   "client" to determine which end you got after fork().  If you use
   the assuan sock interface, you must call assuan_sock_init after
   setting global context defaults.  Add a NULL as the last arg to
   assuan_register_command.

 * Pth support has changed.  This now follows the same style as
   libgcrypt by setting system hook callbacks.

 * Interface changes relative to the 1.0.5 release:

Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.3 (2007-08-24)
------------------------------------------------

 * New type assuan_fd_t and constant ASSUAN_INVALID_FD for better W32
   support.  It does not change the semantics under Unix.  Under W32
   all file descriptors are now guaranteed to be system handles.

 * New functions assuan_process_done and assuan_inquire_ext to support
   external event loops.

 * Changed the license of the library code back to LGPLv2.1 to support
   a bunch of GPLv2(only) software which does not allow the use of
   LGPLv3.  Note that this is only a temporary change and authors of
   GPLv2(only) software are asked to switch to GPLv3 or to add an
   exception which allow the use of LPGLv3 software.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.2 (2007-07-05)
------------------------------------------------

 * Changed license to LGPLv3.

   macros are provided to to check for this.  The pth version is only
   build if Pth is available.

 * configure does now check that descripotor passing is available.  A
   way to check at runtime for this is also provided

------------------------------------------------

 * Internal cleanups to make inclusion of the code into libraries

 * New function assuan_set_assuan_err_source.  All gpg-error enabled
   software should call this right at startup to switch libassuan into
   the gpg-error style mode.  All error codes are then returned as
   gpg-error style codes (GPG_ERR_ASS_* as well as others).
   If the new macro _ASSUAN_ONLY_GPG_ERRORS is defned all old
   definitions are excluded from assuan.h.

 * Logging of hex strings is now limited to 16 bytes.  To enable
   printing of the full data, a new environment variable
   ASSUAN_FULL_LOGGING may be set to any value.
